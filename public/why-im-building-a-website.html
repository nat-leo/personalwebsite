  <h2>Why I'm building a website.</h2>
  <h3>Friday, July 7th, 2023</h3>
  <p>Hello and welcome to my site! This is where I'll be writing articles on 
    things I found interesting, and I encourage others to check some of them 
    out!</p>
  <p>This is the first article I'm posting, and I think that a discussion on 
    growth is in order. Computers are a giant can of worms - you can go down 
    the rabbit hole of technology and never be seen again.</p>
  <p>Staying organized is of the upmost importance to make sure I don't lose
    my footing or get lost. There are just so many topics that it's a good 
    idea (I think) to keep track of where you've been. Early in my Computer 
    Science career I found that during self-study, before I was in college, 
    I went through an endless loop of "I need to get started." Then I would start reviewing
    data structures and algorithms, starting at the beginning yet again. I 
    don't think it's a good idea to follow this sort of behavior.</p>
  <p>That's because in reality I didn't need to start over, I just needed to
    keep going. But there might be no way of convincing myself of my abilities 
    without proof. Hence this site. The other main antagonist to my own growth
    may be the fundamental idea that's pushed so heavily in media to 
    <b>just start</b>. As though some starting point exists. Usually
    this starting point is a pretty generic place. For Computer Science, people
    generally say do Python and Data Structures and Algorithms, and then tell 
    you that you should be learning how to code to get a better job. I don't 
    think this is the way to go. This isn't especially helpful to me because I 
    didn't get into tech because I wanted a good job, but because I was curious
    about how computers worked. I was also at one point interested in graphic 
    design, but that interest has long since died. </p>
  <p>I was less enamored when my 
    reasons for doing anything in Computer Science were then shifted to job, job, 
    job, becasue then I was just another anxious person looking to cash in on the
    tech boom. My whole persona was gone and I felt like another cog in the wheel
    attempting to eek out a living.</p>
  <p>In reality, Computer Science is a realm that touches every aspect of life and
    I'm doing myself a diservice by starting at the generic starting line like 
    everyone else. There's nothing wrong with starting and exploring what got you 
    interested in CS to begin with. It's okay to start with what fascinates you and 
    find out about what you don't know yet.</p>
  <p>There's one more toxic trait I want to address, and it's involving achievement. 
    I think a big problem is believing that you need to set out to get a bunch of 
    achievements and build a tons of high impact stuff so that your resume gets past 
    the applicant tracking system. It's paralyzing to have the pressure of achievement 
    and impact looming over my shoulder, especially for something I'm trying to enjoy.</p>
  <p>Hence the reason for this site. I want to make sure there are reminders of how far 
    I've come, as well as having documents reminding me of the stuff I've already touched
    on. I also hope this site turns into a central repository of ideas and manuals so I can 
    easily track down important items.</p>
